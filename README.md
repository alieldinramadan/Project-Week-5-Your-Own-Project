## Project Description:

In this project the main interest was to know the relationship between Happiness and the number of hours people spend working. Because most of the people how work a lot of hours usually don't have enough time to socialize, workout or work on personal development. The other interests for the project were to also have a look into people living in all the countries from happy to unhappy and see if there is a relationship between happiness and overeating (Obesity), Alcohol consumption and also Suicide rates in these countries.


## Questions & Hypotheses:

- What are the world's happiest countries?
- What are the world's unhappiest countries?
- Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?
- What is the relationship between happiness and average working hours by country?
- What is the relationship between happiness and obesity among adults by country?
- What is the relationship between happiness and average alchohol consumption per captia by country?
- What is the relationship between happiness and percentage of suicide by country?
